# AuthEntry

**AuthEntry** is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance server access control by requiring new or unverified players to answer a predefined security question before gaining full interaction privileges. Until verification is complete, players are restricted from chatting, moving, or interacting.

## Features

- Enforces an identity challenge (e.g., security question)
- Temporarily restricts:
  - Chat messages
  - Player movement
  - World interaction
  - Damage reception
    
- Configurable list of accepted answers
- Admin commands for manual verification management
- Persists verified player data via `verified.yml`


## Commands

| Command                      | Description                                       |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/auth <player>`            | Toggles on/off verification status for a player  |
| `/auth list`              | Lists verified and pending players               |
| `/auth enable/disable`      | Enable and disable the security freeze           |
| `/auth status`              | Checks to see if the plugin is enabled/disabled  |
